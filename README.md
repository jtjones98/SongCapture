# SongCapture (Work in Progress)
SongCapture is an app for quickly adding songs, captured through the mic or from screenshots, to pre-selected playlists in one go. When completed, SongCapture will include the following features:
- Identify songs playing from mic
- Identify songs from music app screenshots such as Apple Music and Spotify
- Automatically add identified songs to any number of playlists across Apple Music and Spotify
- Identify songs playing or songs from screenshots and quickly add to playlists through an app extension.

# Framework
- This project will start off fully UIKit with plans to slowly replace views with SwiftUI throughout project development. Reasoning for this is purely educational, ensuring there's a clear understanding of:
  - UIKit essentials, lifecycle, UI creation, etc
  - How to convert UIKit code into SwiftUI
  - Working in a codebase with a combination of both UIKit and SwiftUI.
